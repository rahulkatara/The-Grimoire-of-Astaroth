## Cache

Say 8 KB cache, block size is 64 bytes, and 32-bit memory

8KB = 2<sup>12</sup> B

When you are searching for a particular element - `look up`

We need the 26 bits of tag and 6 bits of offset to identify a particular element.
Tag = Block Address. &rarr; To identify block
Offset = Data Address. &rarr;  To identify data inside the block.

> Address Format

| Tag | Offset |
|-|-|

Typically, the tag and the block, we use two arrays (block array and tag array). Okay and essentially these two must be of equal size (equal number of entries).

Address is split into tag address and the other part is the offset address. So hit rates we have already studied. 

- Cache rate = (# hits ) / (# hits + #misses) = (# hits)/(# access)
- Average memory access time (AMAT):
	- (hit-rate &times; hit-latency



> Can reducing AMAT improve performance?

### Blocks and Addressing the Cache

- Memory is logically divided into fixed-size blocks
- Each block maps to a location in the cache, determined by the index bits in the address
- Say there are 128 blocks for eg
	- 128 blocks require 2<sup>7</sup> accesses. I need 7 bits for each block.
	- In each block I am referring to a particular data element with 6 bits to identify a particular element.
	- Each block is identified by an index bit.

> 8 bit address

| tag | index | byte in block |
| - | - | - |
| 2b | 3 bits | 3 bits |

- Cache access:
	- index into the tag and data stores with index bits in address
	- check valid big in tag store
	- compare tag bits in address with the stored in tag store

- If the block is in the cache (cache hit), the stored tag should be valid and match the tag of the block.

### Example

Suppose there are different blocks and I have to get an element from the memory to the cache.
The big question is where can I place the element in this cache.

- If cache size is 8KB with block size 64 bytes you have 128 possible blocks where you can store the element.

> Method 1
- Suppose that some blocks are filled, and some blocks are free. You have to check if 0 is having space, 1 is having space, etc.
	- Whenever you have to read the memory, again you have to search the cache.
	- **Full cache traversed** &#8680; Very slow

> Method 2
 
- You could decide the block of storage from the first 7 elements of the data element.
	- Faster reading and writing
	- If the corresponding block is full, you cannot store the element in the block even though there are other empty blocks.

> Modification to Method 2
- Map an element to a set of two / three blocks...
