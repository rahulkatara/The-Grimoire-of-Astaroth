While designing the architecture of a system, we must keep both the hardware builder and the programmer's interests in mind.

>"The purpose of computing is [to gain] insight."

_We gain and generate insight by solving problems_
_How do we ensure problems are solved by electrons?_

## Levels of transformation
||
|-|
| Problem |
|Algorithm| 
|Program/Language|
|Runtime System (VM, OS, MMM) ==> Interface|
|ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)|
|Micro-architecture|
|Logic Gates|
|Devices|
|Electrons|

- ISA => Physical interface / contract between software and hardware. Levels above ISA are part of software (users's view) , and levels below it are part of hardware.
- The architecture should be designed to optimise user's view.
## Computer Architecture Today

- Speed difference between microprocessor and memory is called the memory gap. There are jobs waiting to be executed for the microprocessors, but the microprocessor needs to wait for the information to come from the memory. 
	- To solve this problem, we use the concept of cached memory. Memory is loaded before-hand.
- These programs affect all parts of the computing stack - if we do not change the way we design systems.
- There is no clear, definitive answer to these problems.

## A Modern System

- L1 cache inside a core. 
- L2 ¯\\___(ツ)___/¯
- L3 is shared among all cores.
- RAM chip, DRAM (Dynamic RAM)

## A Trend: Many Cores on a Chip

- We can also use threads to distribute a task over multiple cores. (Parallelism at the chip level). 
- What we want:
	- N times the system performance with N times the cores. This isn't practically observed today though.
## Why disparity in slowdowns?
