### What's the difference and why?
- Functionality (Does it meet the specification?)
- Reliability
- Space requirement
- Cost
- Scalability
- Comfort level of users
- Happiness level of users
- Aesthetics
- ...

> How to evaluate the goodness of design is always a critical question

- Who are the users?
- What is the problem statement?
- **We write a set of specifications/standards**

## What is computer architecture?
The science and art of designing, selecting, and interconnecting **hardware components** and designing the **hardware/software interface** to create a computing system that meets functional, performance, energy consumption, cost, and other specific goals.
- Software that we use in the computer must be compatible with the hardware

## Computer Architecture Requirements
- Both (**software and humanity trends**) and (**technologies and their issues**) and the resulting requirements and constraints
- Hybrid Main Memory
- General purpose GPUs
- Persistent Memory Storage
- Heterogeneous Processors and Accelerators

## Why Study Computer Arch?
- **Enable better systems**: make computers
	- Faster 
	- Cheaper
	- Smaller
	- More reliable
	by exploiting advances and changes in underlying technologies and circuits
- **Enable new applications**
	- Life-like 3-D visualisation 20 yrs ago? VR?
	- Self Driving cars?
	- Personalised genomics? Personalised medicine?
	- IOT + Cloud + Mobile...
- **Enable better solutions** to problems

> Why do computers work the way that they do?

## An Enabler: Moore's Law
![Moore's Law](https://www.gianlucamancusi.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/havesense.png)

```

```
**Moore's Law** refers to **Moore's** perception that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years, though the cost of computers is halved.

## Role of the (Computer) Architect
- Look backward (to the past)
	- Understand the designs of the past, analyse what they did correctly and what went wrong. Rectify those mistakes and build better systems.
- Look forward (to the future)
	- Be a dreamer create new designs
	- Push the state of the art. Evaluate new choices 
- Look up (towards problems in the computing stack)
	- Understand imp problems in nature
	- Develop architectures and ideas to solve imp problems
- Look down (towards device/circuit tech)
	- Understand the capabilities of the underlying technology
	- Predict and adapt to the future of technology (you are designing for N years ahead). 
	- Future technologies must be backward compatible to current systems. _You shouldn't need to build a whole new architecture to accommodate future systems_.

## Major High-Level Goals of This Course
### In class time: 
- Understand the principles and precedents.

### During homework:
- Enable us to evaluate trade-offs, of different designs and ideas.
- Enable us to develop principled designs
- Enable us to make out-of-the-box designs

> The focus is on principles, precedents, and how to use them for new designs
