We are trying to understand architecture by taking simplerisc as an example.

Every program that we execute, it has several instructions and these instructions themselves can be designed in a way that they have micro instructions.

We are trying to understand how to design these micro-programs such that these instructions can be redesigned whenever we want. The structure must be easily modified.

Unlike micro-programming architecture, hard wired architecture use predefined static logic. Whenever there is a firmware update in micro-programming architecture, you simply use the new set of instructions.

## Micro-instructions
### General Instructions
- mloadIR (m - load - Instruction Register)
	- Loads the instruction register (ir) with the contents of the instruction
	- Part of fetch cycle
- mdecode
	- Waits for 1 cycle. Meanwhile all the decode registers get populated.
	- Part of decode cycle
- mswitch
	- Sends the instructions based on the loaded values for execution.Loads the set of micro instructions corresponding to a program instruction.

### Move Instructions
- mmov
	- r1, r2
	- r1, r2, < args > : r1 <- r2, send the value of args on the bus
- mmovi
	- r1, < imm >
		- Move immediate value into r1


### Add and Branch Instructions
- madd r1, imm, < args >
	- r1 <- r1 + imm
	- send < args > on the bus
- mbeq r1, imm, < label >
	- if (r1 == imm), upc = addr(label)
	- upc = micro program controller
- mb < label >
	- upc = addr(label)
	- Move without a condition

## Implementing Instructions in Microcode
### The microcode preamble
A program has several instructions and each instruction has several micro instructions.
Each micro instruction has a preamble.

Whenever a micro instruction gets executed it must start with this preamble:

```
.begin:
mloadIR     % Load the program counter
mdecode     % Decode the instuction
madd pc, 4  % Increment progarm counter
mswitch     % Switch to the first microsintruction in the microcode sequence of the prog. instuction
```
Even if there is a branch instruction, `madd pc, 4` is called. And further down if there is a branch instruction, it overrides the PC with the correct address.

### Homework:
- Change the call instruction 
- Vertical vs/ Horizontal Microprogramming
