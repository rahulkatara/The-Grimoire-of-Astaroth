## Why do we want to study economics?
- We have unlimited wants, but limited resources. 
- ==>Scarcity of resources forces us to make choices.
- The study of economics helps us make decisions.

## Choices
- Scarcity forces us to make choices.
- Why choices?
- To fulfil:
	- Needs: Things we need to survive
	- Wants: Things we don't need to survive, but make us happy

> Economics is the study of how people make choices to satisfy their unlimited wants with scarce resources.

## Trade-offs
Since you can't have all your needs/wants satisfied, you must choose to satisfy some needs/wants over others. This is called making trade-offs.

## Opportunity Cost
- Any choice has a cost.
- **Opportunity Cost** is the value of the next best thing.
- For example: You decided to use Facebook for one hour. Instead, you could've:
	- Read a book
	- Sleep for an hour
	- If you worked, you could've earned money.
	- Done chores

## Shortage is not scarcity
- Shortage: short period of time when an item cannot be purchased.
- Hence, shortage is only temporary, while scarcity is not.

## Economic Ideas
- People are rational
- People respond to economic incentives
- Optional decisions are made at the margin

### Rationality
- People are rational
- e.g.: People won't intentionally buy stale food. They'll only buy good food
- Another example: Buying a car, we:
	- Do extensive research
	- Evaluate all alternatives
	- Purchase our best choice

### Economic incentives
- An incentive is a motivator to get someone to change his/her behaviour.

### Marginal Decisions
- When making decisions:
	- Marginal Benefit (MB) should be compared to Marginal Cost (MC).
	- Choice is rational if (MB) > (MC).
- Example:
	- MB: By studying Eco for one more hour will increase my Eco test score by 5 marks.
	- MC: Studying Math instead of Eco will increase my Math test score by 4 marks.
	- If you decide to study Eco, then 5 points are more valuable than 4 points.

>You make one decision over another, because the benefit of choosing decision A over B outweighs the cost of choosing A over B.

If MC = MB, then we say that you are indifferent between the two choices. Both situations will give you the same amount of 'happiness'. 
## Three economic questions
![3 Questions of Economics](./3_questions.png)

1. What to produce?
2. How to produce?
3. For whom to produce?

## Types of Economies
| Economy | Definition | Example |
|--|--|--|
|  Planned | Government decides on what, how, and for whom the products are made  | Cuba, China, Laos|
|Mixed|Individuals, firms, and govt decides on what, how, and for whom to produce|USA, UK, Japan, India|
|Market|Individuals and firms decide on what, how, and for whom| Hong Kong |

>The government shouldn't ***control*** what the markets produce, but they should ***regulate*** the market. While the firms need independence in how they want to conduct business, the govt. should also look out for the well being of the economy and its citizens.

Key players of an economy are: 
- Individuals 
- Firms 
- Government.

> Most of the economies are now mixed.

Problems with involvement of govt in market economies:
- If the house rent (e.g. 10000) is okay with a tenant and with the landlord, then it's fine. 
- Sometimes, the tenants might not be able to pay 10000. Then, govt. might intervene and fix the rent to 5000.
- This might cause tenants to not give the house for rent.

> Hence, government must not intervene in markets
