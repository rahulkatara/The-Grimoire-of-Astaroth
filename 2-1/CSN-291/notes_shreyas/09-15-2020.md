# September 15

So far we have discussed the first chapter of Grady Booch.

So whatever I am discussing in today's class and some of the next few classes, it will covered by the second chapter of Grady Booch.

#### Abstraction and decomposition are important methods of dealing with complexity

## How are Abstraction and Decomposition Principles Used in Design?

Two principal ways:
- Modular design
- Layered design

### Modularity
- Modularity is a fundamental attribute of any good design.
	- Decomposition of a problem cleanly into modules
	- Modules are almost independent of each other
	- **Divide and Conquer**

There are many ways to decompose a problem using modularity, some methods are better than others. You should decompose them in a way that the modules should be independent of each other. They can never be 100% independent though, but they should be largely independent.

There are some principles to follow when you are decomposing problems.

- If modules are independent:
	- Modules can be understood separately
		- Reduces complexity greatly

### Layered Design

Ultimately decomposition is dependent on your logic building capability.

The first one is a tree like structure. It is difficult to have a structure like that. You should try to make a tree-like layered structure as much as possible.

### Visibility and Layering
- A module A is said to be visible by another module B
	- If A directly or indirectly calls B
- Backward jumps are characteristics of bad design.

Another important thing about the layer design is that a given module should be unaware of the higher module

## Abstraction
- A module is unaware (how to invoke, etc) of the higher level modules
- Lower-level modules:
	- Do input/output and other low-level functions
- Upper level modules:
	- Managerial functions

### High-level Design
- High-level design maps functions into modules {fi} {mj} such that:
	- Each module has high cohesion. It means that the functions in a module belong together because of some similarity. 
	- Coupling among modules is as low as possible 
	- Modules are organised in a neat hierarchy
- High level design is aka software architecture
- It would be functional and object oriented design
- Outcome of high level design: What?

If you are building the design in such a way that you can relate modules using elementary variables, then it is better than relating them through objects. Coupling is high when they are related with composite data item, lower when they are dependent with elementary data items.

Cohesiveness must be high, and coupling must be low

You first pick processes for your software, and then break them down into separated layers such that the coupling between them is low, and cohesiveness is high.

## Design Approach
### Function oriented
- Break down functions into smaller and smaller parts.
- You will map the functions to the different modules. 
- For example:
	- A library management system is your top level function
		- Create a function to assign member number
		- Card Issue
		- Print bill
		- etc
	- Like above, each function can be decomposed into sub-functions. This continues until you have some sub-function that will 

## Object oriented Design
- System is viewed as a collection of objects / entities.

- In library automation software:
	- Each library member / book would be an object.
		- With their own data and functions
	- Functions defined for an object cannot directly refer to or change the data of other objects. Provides security.

- Objects have their own internal data:
	- Defines their state
- Similar objects constitute a class
	- Each object is a member of some class
- Classes may inherit features from super-classes
	- There are some common properties of different classes, but some different. So, we can create a super class which stores the common properties, and the individual classes can 
- Conceptually, objects communicate with each other through message passing.

### OOD vs FOD
- Unlike function oriented design:
	- in OOD, the basic abstraction is not function based, but object based.
- In OOD, softeare is eveloped by designing objects first, then functions.
- 
Grady Booch sums up this fundamental difference by saying:
>Identify verbs if you are after procedural design and nouns if you are after object-oriented design
