## Software Engineering?

* Engineering approach to develop software
  * If we want to build a small house, we might contact local company.
    * Benefits: 
      * Low cost 
      * Personal relations 
      * The company will have a local reputation to uphold.
    * Disadvantages: 
      * High charge 
      * They might not take up project (because it'll be too small a job for them and they might incur losses)
      * Time consuming
  * If we want to build 30 story building, we might contact a huge contractor.
    * We want efficiency and reliability (don't want the building to fall ðŸ¥´)
    * If we contact local contractor for large project, the contractor might back out after some time, they might not have resources, etc

* Application for software engineers:
  * If we are handling a small problem, then we can handle it ourselves, we don't need to contact others. 
  * If the project is very large, then we might need to outsource it. 
* Systematic collection of past experience
